EXPERIMENT: Timer-based LED Toggle using 8051

Write an assembly language program in 8051 to generate a 5 ms delay using Timer 1 in Mode 1 and toggle an LED connected to Port 1.7 continuously

Aim:
To write an assembly language program in 8051 microcontroller to generate a 5 ms delay using Timer 1 in Mode 1 and continuously toggle an LED connected to Port 1.7

Algorithm:
1.Initialize Port 1 for LED output.
2.Set Timer 1 in Mode 1 (16-bit) using TMOD register.
3.Load TH1 = 0xEC and TL1 = 0x78.
4.Start Timer 1 using SETB TR1.
5.Wait until overflow flag (TF1) is set.
6.Stop timer, clear flag, and return.
7.After delay, toggle the LED on P1.7 using CPL P1.7.
8.Repeat the process continuously.

PROGRAM:
```
ORG 0000H        
MAIN:
    MOV TMOD, #10H    ; Timer 1 in Mode 1 (16-bit timer)
    CLR P1.7          ; Initialize LED OFF
REPEAT:
    CPL P1.7          ; Toggle LED connected to Port 1.7
    ACALL DELAY       ; Call 5 ms delay subroutine
    SJMP REPEAT       ; Repeat forever
;------------------------------------
; Subroutine: 5 ms delay using Timer 1
;------------------------------------
DELAY:
    MOV TH1, #0ECH    ; Load high byte for 5 ms delay
    MOV TL1, #078H    ; Load low byte for 5 ms delay
    SETB TR1          ; Start Timer 1
WAIT:
    JNB TF1, WAIT     ; Wait until Timer 1 overflows
    CLR TR1           ; Stop Timer 1
    CLR TF1           ; Clear overflow flag
    RET               ; Return to main program
END
```

RESULT:
Thus, the assembly language program for generating a 5 ms delay using Timer 1 in Mode 1 and toggling an LED connected to Port 1.7 was successfully executed and verified in Keil ÂµVision.
